To execute:
on file -> cd src/Parallel/
	   make
	   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$NumberOfThreadsDesired$
	   ./fast-mrmr -a NumberFeaturesSelected -f FileInput -c (NumberOfClassFeature+1)

FileInput -> the code only understands the .mrmr format to translate to this format:
	   cd data-reader
           make
           ./mrmr-reader input_file output_file
	   -> input_file -> csv format with rows as datasamples and columns as features, and discretized (mrmr works properlly with a discretized entry)

Output -> The execution offers 3 outputs.
	-> SelectedFeatures -> in order
	-> Relevance Time -> Time to compute relevance for all features
	-> Redundacy Time -> Time to compute all redundancy step
	-> Total Time -> Time to execute all code -> read, inicialization and destruction included.

CSV Directory -> Contains the small datasets in csv format, already discretized with k = 3
Discretizer Directory -> Python code to discretize a csv file with k states -> EqualWidth mode.
	-> Execution example: python /Discretrizer/equal.py -f fileInput -o outputFile -k states -nf NumberOfFeaturesDataset -c (NumberOfClassFeature+1)
